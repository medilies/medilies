# Hi, I'm Ilies

I specialize in backend development using PHP, with a preference for the Laravel framework. My focus extends to developing CLI tools, and when working on full-stack projects, I choose between Vanilla JS or Vue JS for building frontends. I prioritize expanding my expertise in software architecture and core technologies over chasing after frameworks.

I'm currently working on the [RowBloom library](https://github.com/row-bloom), documented extensively in this [wiki](https://github.com/row-bloom/row-bloom/wiki) and managed using [Kanban](https://github.com/orgs/row-bloom/projects/1).

As a network engineer, I contribute to tools that enhance the engineering process at [eazyip](https://github.com/eazyip/eazyip.github.io).

These repositories served educational purposes and come with informative READMEs: [messenger-clone](https://github.com/medilies/messenger-clone), [go-locate-em](https://github.com/medilies/go-locate-em).

I've worked on translation libraries for the PHP ecosystem and may revisit them for further improvements: [PHP-JSON-Tongue](https://github.com/elaborate-code/PHP-JSON-Tongue), [jigsaw-localization](https://github.com/elaborate-code/jigsaw-localization), and [laravel-json-tongue](https://github.com/elaborate-code/laravel-json-tongue).

If you're working on Laravel projects for the Algerian market, check out [laravel-algerian-education-system](https://github.com/elaborate-code/laravel-algerian-education-system) or [laravel-algerian-provinces](https://github.com/elaborate-code/laravel-algerian-provinces).

Some functional projects I'm no longer actively maintaining include [countdown-component.js](https://github.com/medilies/countdown-component.js), [glpi-docker](https://github.com/medilies/glpi-docker), and [tictactoe](https://github.com/medilies/tictactoe).
