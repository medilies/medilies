# Hi, I'm Ilies

I mainly do backend dev using PHP prefering to use Laravel as a framework. I like to develop CLI tools and when I do full stack project I either pick Vanilla JS or Vue JS for building the frontends. I'm against running after frameworks knowledge and prefer to expand my expertise with sotfware architecture and core technologies. I'm also intrested in learning Go and getting better with DevOps tools.

I am currently working on [RowBloom library](https://github.com/row-bloom) It is extensively documented at this [wiki](https://github.com/row-bloom/row-bloom/wiki) and maintained using this [Canban](https://github.com/orgs/row-bloom/projects/1).

I am a network engineer and I try to make tools to enhance the engineering process at [eazyip](https://github.com/eazyip/eazyip.github.io)

These repos served me for educational purposes and has very informative readmes [messenger-clone](https://github.com/medilies/messenger-clone), [go-locate-em](https://github.com/medilies/go-locate-em)

I worked on a series of trasnlation libraries for the PHP ecosystem and I might get back to it to extend its capabilities [PHP-JSON-Tongue](https://github.com/elaborate-code/PHP-JSON-Tongue), [jigsaw-localization](https://github.com/elaborate-code/jigsaw-localization), and [laravel-json-tongue](https://github.com/elaborate-code/laravel-json-tongue).

If you are working on Laravel products aimed at the algerian market you may be intrested in [laravel-algerian-education-system](https://github.com/elaborate-code/laravel-algerian-education-system) or [laravel-algerian-provinces](https://github.com/elaborate-code/laravel-algerian-provinces)

I matured enough to stop making small libraries like these [laravel-resource-routes](https://github.com/elaborate-code/laravel-resource-routes) XD

Here are some projects that are functiona but I'm not concerned anymore by maintainning them [countdown-component.js](https://github.com/medilies/countdown-component.js), [glpi-docker](https://github.com/medilies/glpi-docker), and [tictactoe](https://github.com/medilies/tictactoe).
